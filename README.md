//Flipcards

For this project, you will build an application to quiz the user with flipcards -- that is, a question shown with the answer hidden, and then the answer shown afterwards.

//Specifications  

The application must:

1) Have user registration, login, and logout
2) Allow the user to create multiple decks of flipcards
3) Allow the user to create flipcards within a deck
4) Allow the user to edit a flipcard
5) Allow the user to delete a flipcard
6) Allow the user to start a quiz using a flipcard deck
(Ideally, this quiz would show the cards randomly)
7) When a flipcard is flipped, allow the user to choose whether they answered successfully or unsuccessfully, and record that answer

//Best practices to implement  

In this application, you should:

Use test-driven development to build the application
Store hashes for user passwords instead of text
